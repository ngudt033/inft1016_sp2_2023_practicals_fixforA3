# inft1016_sp2_2023_practicals_fixforA3
This is a new repository for assignment 3 as something is not allowing me to commit and sync with assignment 3.

My Webpage

Description:
This project codes for a website with the information and techniques learned from the recent past weeks at the INFT1016 practicals. The information contained within this project contains information from Assignment 1 aswell as Assignment 2. As the information is based on those assignments, the main focus of this project is the effect of AI on small businesses and the role I want to pursue as a data engineer.
